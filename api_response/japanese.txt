Chardonnay is a great friend to buttery, creamy dishes, while sauvignon blanc can complement herb or citrus-centric dishes. A light-bodied, low-tannin red such as the pinot noir goes great with broiled or grilled salmon. One wine you could try is Waterbrook Reserve Chardonnay. It has 5 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 20 dollars.",

Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir.

Chardonnay is a great friend to buttery, creamy dishes, while sauvignon blanc can complement herb or citrus-centric dishes. A light-bodied, low-tannin red such as the pinot noir goes great with broiled or grilled salmon. You could try Vie di Romans Chardonnay. Reviewers quite like it with a 4.9 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 36 dollars per bottle.",

The nose is diaphanous with exotic jasmine notes and a touch of wet stone. The mouth is a complex layering of white peach, honeydew melon, and a hint of vanilla bean, with a lengthy finish reminiscent of creamy lemon curd. The wine is light and elegant, with a food-friendly acid that will make it a welcome addition to any bite.",
