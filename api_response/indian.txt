I happen to have all these ingredients on hand and decided to put them all together...it was a delicious success. I served this a couple ways. One was over a bed of rice, in a bowl all by itself. For the third way, I combined the leftover rice and stew together creating another wonderful way to enjoy leftovers. I topped my leftover stew with sliced avocado on top, I highly recommend doing this! Avocado is such a nice addition to almost any dish. All ways were hearty and filling while being full of wholesome nutrition. This recipe is easy to put together and is ready in under an hour.I do have a few spices in here which include ginger, red pepper flakes, turmeric, curry and cumin. Feel free to simplify by just using curry and maybe another spice or two. You can still pull off a flavorful lentil stew with simply using curry alone as well. As with all recipes, adjust spices to taste adding anything more or less to your liking.Curry Red Lentil Stew with Kale & Chickpeas",
